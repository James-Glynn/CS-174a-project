1. Introduciton and Implementation:
  Our project is an endless world simulation, in which the player can walk 
through a procedurally generated world. While deciding what to create for this
assingment, our team agreed that the previous projects in this class had all
been small scenes that had limited scale. Since it runs in the browser, 
Tiny Graphics seems to be a big limiter. 

// TODO fix flow 
The walking plane is infinite, so as the person keeps on walking the biomes 
continuously change (spawning in different types of trees with different leaf 
colors). 


2. Advanced Features:
The advanced features that we chose was bump mapping.
